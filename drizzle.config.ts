/**
 * REMINDER:
 * Whenerver introspection is done, the schema file will update.
 * But for movement table, the productsDetails column will be missing types since it's a jsonb column.
 * To fix this, we need to manually add the types to the schema file.
 * Just place the below code at the chain of productDetails column in the schema file.
 * .$type<SelectProductType>()
